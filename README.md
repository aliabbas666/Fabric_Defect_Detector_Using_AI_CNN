# Fabric_Defect_Detector_Using_AI_CNN
1) Used Pre-trained ImageNet weights for better result.
2) UsedÂ Convolutional Neural Network for Classification between Defected and Non-Defected Images.
##Procedure to Run
1)Replace Data folder with your Fabric or Images data to be classified(If required).
2)Run the Code.ipynb file for Training the Machine.
3)After Succeesful Training run testing.ipynb file for testing with new images kept in testing Folder.
